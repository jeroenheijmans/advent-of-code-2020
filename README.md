## Running

I'm starting (and might stick with) `npm install -g ts-node` and then just `ts-node day01.ts`.
Then again, this might be an excuse to try Deno?

## Lessons Learned

Some learned lesson for each day:

1. Dev setups ar nearly never trivial.
2. Dev may require ramping up first.
3. Devs filling in blanks might be _needed_ sometimes.
4. Devs should test code with realistic data.
5. Abstractions _will_ leak.
6. Not everything is as hard as it seems.
